# About

**AlQuran.ca Better Annotations**

Adds brackets around translator annotations on alquran.ca to distinguish them from the Quran translation.

## Purpose

Improve readability of the translation of the Quran on alquran.ca by adding brackets around translator annotations to distinguish them from the Quran translation.

## Description

This extension improves readability on alquran.ca/read by adding brackets around the translator's annotations.

The translator uses italics to indicate their own explanatory notes that are not part of the original Arabic text. While helpful, italicized text can be easy to miss. This extension wraps those sections in [brackets] to make them more visually distinct.

**Features:**
- Automatically adds brackets around all italicized annotations
- Merges adjacent annotations into a single bracketed group
- Works seamlessly as you navigate between chapters
- No configuration needed - just install and read

**Example:**
- Before: This Book, *the Qur'ān, is a Book* in which there is no doubt
- After: This Book, [*the Qur'ān, is a Book*] in which there is no doubt

The extension only activates on alquran.ca/read and does not collect any data.
